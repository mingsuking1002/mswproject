# Task: Exporting Conversation for Cross-AI Compatibility

The goal is to provide a highly compatible file (Markdown) that captures the full context of our conversations, project state, and technical decisions, allowing other AIs to seamlessly continue the work.

## Phase 1: Planning & Research
- [x] Locate conversation logs and artifact directories
- [x] Review existing [brain_summary.md](file:///C:/Users/ksh00/.gemini/antigravity/brain/70f7bf91-4f32-4d13-becb-c191783a758c/brain_summary.md) and [walkthrough.md](file:///C:/Users/ksh00/.gemini/antigravity/brain/70f7bf91-4f32-4d13-becb-c191783a758c/walkthrough.md) for context
- [/] Define the structure of the `AI_KNOWLEDGE_BRIDGE.md` export file
- [/] Draft the implementation plan

## Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Create `AI_KNOWLEDGE_BRIDGE.md` in the project root
- [ ] Populate it with consolidated project history, technical stack, and current status
- [ ] Add instructions for other AIs on how to digest the context

## Phase 3: Verification
- [ ] Review the file content for clarity and completeness
- [ ] Verify that all links to existing project files are correct
- [ ] Present the export to the user for final feedback
