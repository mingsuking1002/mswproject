# Exporting Conversation for Cross-AI Compatibility

This plan outlines the creation of a "Knowledge Bridge" document. Since raw system logs are in a binary or system-specific format, a structured Markdown file is the most portable and effective way to share context with other AIs.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This export file will contain a summary of our past sessions and current progress. It will **not** be a word-for-word transcript of every message, as those are stored in a binary format by the system. However, it will include all critical decisions, technical designs, and next steps.

## Proposed Changes

### Project Root

#### [NEW] [AI_KNOWLEDGE_BRIDGE.md](file:///c:/Users/ksh00/Documents/GitHub/mswproject/AI_KNOWLEDGE_BRIDGE.md)
A comprehensive document designed to get any AI up to speed on the project.
- **Section 1: Project Identity**: Overview of `mswproject`.
- **Section 2: The Story So Far**: Summarized history of MSW API research, Battle System design, and Visual Novel conversion.
- **Section 3: Technical Stack**: Details on MSW Lua, Web (HTML/CSS/JS), and DevOps scripts.
- **Section 4: Current State & Next Steps**: What we are working on right now.
- **Section 5: AI Collaboration Guide**: Prompt-like instructions for the next AI to read this file and assume the role of a development partner.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Verification
- I will check the file existence and link integrity.
- I will verify that the Markdown is properly formatted for readability.

### Manual Verification
- Ask the user to review the content to ensure all critical context they need for "cross-AI work" is captured.
