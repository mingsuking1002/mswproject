# MapleStory Survivors - Game Design Proposal & Estimate

# 1. Project Overview
**Title (Tentative):** Maple Survivors
**Genre:** Roguelite Survival (Vampire Survivors-like)
**Theme:** MapleStory IP (2D Pixel Art, Iconic Classes, Monsters)
**Platform:** Web (HTML5/Canvas) or PC

## Core Concept
Survive against endless waves of classic MapleStory monsters using iconic skills that trigger automatically. Grow your character through Job Advancements and specialized stats (STR/DEX/INT/LUK).

# 2. IP Integration & Content

## Playable Classes (The Explorers)
*Adapting the 5 original classes into clear playstyles.*
- **Warrior:** High HP, close-range AoE (Slash Blast), damage mitigation (Iron Body).
- **Magician:** Low HP, seeking projectiles (Magic Claw), big AoE spells (Thunder Bolt).
- **Bowman:** Ranged piercing (Arrow Blow), critical hit focus.
- **Thief:** Fast hit-count, evasion (Lucky Seven), mobility.
- **Pirate:** Gun/Knuckle mix, rapid fire or dashes.

## Enemies
- **Early Game:** Snail, Blue Snail, Red Snail, Slime.
- **Mid Game:** Ribbon Pig, Green Mushroom, Horned Mushroom.
- **Late Game:** Stone Golem, Cargo, Tauromacis.
- **Bosses:** Mushmom, Zombie Mushmom, Jr. Balrog, Crimson Balrog, Zakum (Final Stage).

## Maps
- **Henesys Hunting Ground:** Open field, simple layout.
- **Ant Tunnel:** Claustrophobic, higher spawn density.
- **Orbis Tower/Sky:** Verticality constraints or cloud platforms.

# 3. Game Mechanics

## Core Loop
1. **Kill Mobs** -> Drop **EXP Orbs** (represented as Maple Leaves or Ribbons).
2. **Level Up** -> Choose 1 of 3 Random Upgrades (Skills or Stats).
3. **Survive** -> Timer-based difficulty increase.

## "Maple" Twist Checklist
- [ ] **Job Advancement System:** At level 10, 30, 60, skills evolve dramatically (e.g., Magic Claw -> Thunderbolt).
- [ ] **Stat System:** STR/DEX/INT/LUK actually matter.
    - STR: Weapon Size / Knockback resistance.
    - DEX: Attack Speed / Crit Rate.
    - INT: Cooldown Reduction / Pickup Range (Magnet).
    - LUK: Crit Damage / Evasion / Double Attack chance.
- [ ] **Equipment:** Drops from elites/bosses (Zhelm, Sauna Robe) providing passive buffs.

# 4. Technical Scope & Estimate

## Recommended Tech Stack
- **Engine:** Phaser 3 (JavaScript/TypeScript) for robust physics and thousands of sprites, or Custom Canvas Engine for lightweight optimization.
- **Assets:** User provided or placeholder pixel art.

## Development Phase Estimate (Solo Developer)
*Based on standard web game development velocity.*

### Phase 1: Prototype (MVP) - ~1-2 Weeks
- Basic movement & physics.
- 1 Character (Warrior).
- 1 Weapon (Slash Blast).
- Basic Enemy AI (Follow player).
- EXP & Level Up UI.

### Phase 2: Content Expansion - ~2-3 Weeks
- Add remaining 4 base classes.
- Implement ~10-15 distinctive weapons/skills.
- Job Advancement logic (Skill Evolution).
- Stat system integration.

### Phase 3: Meta-Progression & Polish - ~2 Weeks
- Main Menu & Character Select.
- Persistent Upgrades (Gold/Mesos shop).
- Sound FX & BGM integration (Maple tracks).

# 5. Questions for User
- Do you have the art assets (spritesheets) ready, or should we use placeholders?
- Should this be a single-stage endless mode or multiple stages?
- Is mobile support required (Touch controls)?
