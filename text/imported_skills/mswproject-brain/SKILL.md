## Overview

This skill packages your Antigravity brain markdown backups as `references/` so Codex can quickly search and cite them while working.

## Usage

1. Search `references/brain/` for relevant keywords.
2. Prefer the docs as source of truth; ask clarifying questions when needed.

### Entry (recommended)

- `references/brain/knowledge_summary.md`

## Notes

- Brain docs: `references/brain/*.md`
